%%% The parameter given to the ``acmsiggraph'' LaTeX class in the

%%% If you are preparing a paper for presentation in the Technical Papers

%%% If you are preparing a paper for presentation at one of our sponsored

%%% Technical Papers program, you should use ``sponsored'' as the parameter.
%%% (Technical Briefs and Game Papers presented at our annual flagship

%%%
%%% If you are preparing a version of your content for review, you should
%%% use ``review'' as the parameter. Line numbers will be added to your
%%% paper, and the submission ID value will be printed across the top of
%%% each page of your paper. (Use the submission ID as the parameter to the
%%% ``TOGonlineID'' command, below.)
%%%
%%% If you are preparing an abstract, typically one to four pages in
%%% length, you should use ``abstract'' as the parameter. No space will
%%% be left clear for the ACM copyright notice, as copyright is not
%%% transferred for abstracts. A small permission notice will be added
%%% to your content during production in the footer of the first page.
%%%
%%% If you are preparing a preprint of your content, you should use
%%% ``preprint'' as the parameter. This is primarily for annual conference
%%% papers; a header reading ``To appear in ACM TOG X(Y)'' will appear on
%%% each page of the formatted output (where X is the volume and Y is the
%%% number of the issue in which it will be published).

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Hands are important. Hands are in the uncanny valley. Hand deformations are challenging because they combine large- and small-scale deformations and wrinkles. Rendering realistic deformable hands using real-world lighting is a difficult problem: local sub-surface scattering effects and global shadowing effects combine to make this hard.

Luckily, the space of hand deformations is much more constrained than that of arbitrary deformation and animation. We will exploit this to accelerate rendering.

We will analyse the subspace of plausible hand deformations and tailor a compact and realistic appearance model for hands that operates entirely within this subspace.

\section{Previous Work}

\input{related}

\section{Deformable Subspace Appearance Model}
\label{sec:approach}

This is where we describe our technique. We can break up the exposition according to our analysis of the subspace (Section~\ref{sec:subspace}), and our rendering model (Section~\ref{sec:model}).

\subsection{Deformable Hand Subspace}
\label{sec:subspace}

Formulate and illustrate the low-dimensionality of hand deformation. Then, do the same for the hand shading space.

\subsection{Subspace Shading}
\label{sec:model}

Reflection equation and PRT 101. LDPRT. SSSSS. Our hybrid model, including the env map segmentation. Our RBF model (and maybe discuss why linear wasn't good enough; compare the two).

\section{Implementation and Results}
\label{sec:results}

Discuss our implementation. Show our results.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This is where we repeat the introduction, except in past tense :)
